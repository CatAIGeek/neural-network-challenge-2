# neural-network-challenge-2
Challenge 19

In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a neural network that HR can use to predict whether employees are likely to leave the company. HR believes that some employees may be better suited to other departments, so I was also asked to predict the department that best fits each employee. 

Before this module, I'd never heard of neural network processing, so I found the contents of study very intriguing (although challenging). Being able to continue to use Google CoLab for this activity allowed me to see even more possibilities with the tool.  Additionally, being able to change the number of epochs, the number of layers in the exercise to see how the model could be improved added to my abiliy to better understand neural networks. I did reach out to  BCS LAs and to a tutor, which both proved very useful in further explaining some of the points of neural networking that I missed in class.
